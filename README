This folder contains experimental code, as well as
code that is too immature to go into trunk.

Don't put any of this unto your OP board firmware.
Don't even THINK about flying any of this.

Unless you know exactly what you are doing.
In that case keep in mind:

	GPL v 3: section 15..

	THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM...


You have been warned!
