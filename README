OpenPilot

The GIT repository you cloned is auto updated from subversion.  Commits have to
go to the subversion repository directly via git svn dcommit.

Any changes to subversion will automatically be applied to this repository and
can be pulled from their branches (latest dev work is in branch "trunk")

To access the subversion repository do the following:

1. Add the following lines to your .git/config file:

===<snip>===========================
[svn-remote "svn"]
        url = svn://svn.openpilot.org/OpenPilot
        fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/trunk
        branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/*
        tags = tags/*:refs/remotes/tags/*
===</snip>==========================

2. pull the latest revision of the MASTER branch from github

	git checkout master;
	git pull;

3. copy the contents of the "git" sub folder within the master "branch" into your own .git folder
   (this will give you correct revision history to the latest subversion revision)
