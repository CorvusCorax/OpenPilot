** Introduction **

These are all the hardware files for the OpenPilot FOSS JTAG, they are complete with all files needed to 
replicate the device easily. This includes all Gerber files, NC Drill files, a detailed BOM with Digikey 
part numbers, all Altium version 9 files, PDF schematic and detailed assembly sheets including 3D artwork.  

The Gerber files included have also been used to produce our production boards.

** History **

The original concept of the FOSS JTAG was created by Piotr Esden-Tempski which he called the Floss JTAG:

http://www.randomprojects.org/wiki/Floss-JTAG

Esden's design was reworked by Rowan Taubitz, the design was changed substantially from Esden's design and 
moved from a 4 layer board to a 2 layer board, a lower cost USB to Serial IC has been used as well as other 
modifications to suit the OpenPilot project. Additionally, the work was entirely redone in Altium Designer. 

To give credit to Esden, the name was kept as the Floss-JTAG, however to avoid confusion name has been 
changed at Esden's request to FOSS JTAG, this still pays homage to the original creator of the device but 
hopefully avoid confusion between the original and the OpenPilot derivative.
